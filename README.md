ag2 server -> bot_server(rudy's) -> bot_private

why not bot_server replies to ag2 server:
1. bot is not good in testing/developing phase, may reply garbage message
2. it got permission to get message, but only visible to Rudy (not visible to other developers)


bot_private is in one Rudy's server, This server can add other developers' bot.
